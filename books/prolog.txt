Tool for searching for books written by specified authors during a time period.

During the time interval [min(year1, year2), max(year1, year2)] (this interval is assumed to be "all time" if unspecified),
this command considers authors whose names contain the substring specified by --author or -a (if no substring is specified,
all relevant authors are searched), and then finds the books whose titles contain the substring specified by --books or -b
that were written by these authors (if no substring is specified, all relevant books are considered).
