Both Grace and I are extremely poor artists, so we did not attempt to draw out any of the maps. This readme will describe the steps a user will take to navigate the website at each level.

Level 1: World Map:

At the world map level, a heat map of terror all over the world will be displayed. When a user hovers over a specific country, some preliminary statistics such as name, attacks per year, etc, will be displayed. Clicking on a country will take the user to level 2, the country level.

Level 2: Country Map:

The country map will operate in the exact same way as the world map. In this case, however, provinces will replace countries. Clicking on a province will take the user to level 3.

Level 3: Province Map:

The province map will contain pins corresponding to the gps data of an attack in our database. Hovering over a pin will give the user preliminary information about the specific attack. Clicking on the pin will take the user to level 4.

Level 4: Specific Attack:

This level will contain all relevant information of a specific terrorist attack. There will be no links to deeper information at this level, so the user will have to use breadcrumbs, the world map icon, the back button, etc, to leave this level.
